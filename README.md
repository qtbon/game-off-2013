# Mint Condition
***
A tv blinks. Urgent Message!  Urgent Message!  A coin walks into view, and a nondescript bill comes on the television.

Bill - Thanks for answering Mr. President.
Coin - No problem, Mr. President.  What's the urgent matter?
Bill - The president has been kidnapped.  We suspect by a gang of credit cards.
Coin - Credit Cards?!  I knew they couldn't be trusted.
Bill - Please, infiltrate their headquarters and bring the president back safely!

Mint Condition is a simplified brawler where you take on an gang of envelope pushing credit cards who want to get rid of change for good.
